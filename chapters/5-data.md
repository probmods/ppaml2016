- Resources
  - This is a shortened version of MH's BDA course.
  - http://forestdb.org/models/bayesian-data-analysis.html
    - In contrast to this page, we might want 2-3 real datasets
- Content
  - *MH to revise content*
  - Input/output of data
  - Occam's razor
  - Various models useful for BDA
  - Use BDA to compare two of the models shown earlier on a dataset
    - logistic regression vs Bayesian neural net
    - a rich cognitive model vs regression
    - text analysis models (topic models, hmms, etc)
  - Making predictions from data
